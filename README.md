# Content to code

## Overview

- _Fork & clone this repository._
- Using the two PDFs, determine the most semantically appropriate HTML tag for each numbered content
- There are two PDFs:
  `content-to-code.pdf`
  — Just the plain content, by itself
  `content-to-code-numbered.pdf`
  — A messier version showing each numbered tag
- _Submit your HTML tag choices with explanations._

## Hand in

On GitHub’s website, on your forked repository, create an Issue labeled “Solution”—and tag your teacher.

Inside the content of the Issue write out your tag choices & explanations. Here’s an example:

```md
1. h1 — The most important content
2. abbr — Defines a shortened word
3. p — Some none specific text content
   ⋮
```

_The above is just an example—not the answers._

**Don’t forget to tag your teacher!**
